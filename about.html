## About

<p>[<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtzhou">LinkedIn</a>] [<a target="_blank" href="/research/zhou_research.pdf">Resume</a>]</p>

<p>I am currently an Applied Research Scientist, Core Machine Learning at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fbseattle/">Facebook Seattle</a>. Before joining Facebook, I worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.oracle.com">Oracle Labs Vancouver</a> in Canada. I earned my Ph.D. in 2015 from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/">Dr. Greg Mori</a>. During my Ph.D., I interned at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a> in fall 2013, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> from fall 2014 to spring 2015.</p>

<p>I am interested in <span class="text-highlight">Machine Learning</span> and <span class="text-highlight">Computer Vision</span> research, and the focus is to develop machine learning algorithms and semantic representations for high-level understanding of image, video and network data.</p>
