  <p>I am currently an Applied Research Scientist, Core Machine Learning at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fbseattle/">Facebook Seattle</a>. Before joining Facebook in 2018, I have worked as a Machine Learning Researcher (Principal Member of Technical Staff) at <a target="_blank" href="https://labs.oracle.com">Oracle Labs Vancouver</a> since 2015. I obtained my Ph.D. from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca">School of Computing Science</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a>, Canada. My thesis advisor is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/">Dr. Greg Mori</a>, and my thesis title is <a href="research/phd_thesis15.pdf">Toward Scene Recognition by Discovering Semantic Structures and Parts</a>. I am interested in machine learning and computer vision research, and the focus is to develop machine learning algorithms and semantic representations for high-level understanding of image and video data.</p>
  <p>I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sdu.edu.cn">Shandong University</a>, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively. During my master's study, I worked with <a target="_blank" href="http://mla.sdu.edu.cn/ylyin.html">Dr. Yilong Yin</a> in the <a target="_blank" href="http://mla.sdu.edu.cn/">MLA Group</a> on fingerprint recognition problems. I visited <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.nju.edu.cn/zhouzh/">Dr. Zhi-Hua Zhou</a>'s <a target="_blank" href="http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/">LAMDA Group</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nju.edu.cn">Nanjing University</a>, and researched on content-based image retrieval in 2008. After that, I spent six months at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monash.edu.au/">Monash University</a>, Australia, where I worked on mass estimation with <a target="_blank" href="http://personal.gscit.monash.edu.au/~kmting/">Dr. Kai Ming Ting</a>. I later joined <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfu.ca">Simon Fraser University</a> as a graduate student and worked under the supervision of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~jpei/">Dr. Jian Pei</a> on contextual outlier detection in 2011. In fall 2013, I interned at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.disneyresearch.com/">Disney Research</a> with <a target="_blank" href="http://cs.brown.edu/~ls/">Dr. Leonid Sigal</a>, working on automatic discovery of scene parts. I also interned at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sap.com/">SAP</a> from fall 2014 to spring 2015, and the project is to develop a proof-of-concept system for graph visualization.</p>
